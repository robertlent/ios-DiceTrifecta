# Dice Trifecta
Dice Trifecta is an iOS game written in Swift where you roll three dice, trying to get as high a score as possible.

Your high score is saved automatically, and can be cleared by pressing the 'Clear High Score' button.

If you roll three dice of the same value (a Trifecta), your score will increase by that value times 100, i.e. If you roll 6's, you will get 600 points.

If you roll two dice of the same value, you will get 50 points.

You receive no points if each dice has a different value.
